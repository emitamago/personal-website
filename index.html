				<h2>Hi, my name is Emi Tsukuda <strong>software engineer</strong>
					<br />
					who love solve problem,
					challenge, make things better
					<br />
				</h2>
				<p>I am originally from <strong>Tokyo, </strong>came to US 2001 to attend school. Graduated
					<strong>Business Administration</strong> and entered jungle of adulthood.</br>
					After couple jobs, I settled in <strong>wild Restaurant industry</strong>.
					Started as a server in small mom and pop restaurant at Reno. I climb ladder quite lots. From small
					restaurant server
					to GM at well known San Francisco restaurant. I think I did good.
					<br />
					<br />
					Beside my busy restaurant life, I randomly found <strong>online coding class</strong> . It was
					beginner Ruby class. I don't know why but I started to
					take the online course. My first struggle was <strong>install Ruby to my machine</strong> . It took
					me whole day to figure out.
					But when I finally installed Ruby, <br />I felt <strong>undescribable excitement and joy.</strong>
					I think I fell in <strong>love</strong> with coding at the moment.
					<br />
					<br />
					Busy life prevented to continue to study coding for while. But back of my mind, coding was alway
					there.
					It came up to my mind time to time, and asking me <strong>"hey, when you finally admit that you
						can't run away from me???"</strong>
					<br />
					<br />
					Winter 2018, I finally made up my mind. I admitted to accept love of my life.
					I researched options for me to learn coding. There are many options, well too many options.
					But I choose to attend coding bootcamp. I found it is the best way for me.
					Again, research many bootcamp and finally found the best bootcamps for me.
					<a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/">Rithm School</a>
					<br />
					<br />
					Days at <strong>Rithm</strong> was nothing but fun. I was having too much fun and often I caught
					myself smiling
					on my way to Rithm. I learn many many things everyday. Instructors were extremely helpful and
					knowledgeable.
					Now I am graduating school and can't wait to see <strong>my next journey!</strong>
